# Ruffini-Abel Theorem, proof by contradiction

# Assume that there exists a general algebraic solution for the equation of the fifth degree or higher
# Let this solution be represented by the function f(x)
def f(x):
    # We don't know what f(x) is, so we don't have to define it
    pass

# Let's test f(x) by plugging in some values for x
print(f(1))  # Outputs: ?
print(f(2))  # Outputs: ?
print(f(3))  # Outputs: ?

# Now let's try to use f(x) to solve the following equation: x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0
# We can do this by setting x equal to f(x) and seeing if the equation is satisfied
x = f(x)
if x ** 5 + x ** 4 + x ** 3 + x ** 2 + x + 1 == 0:
    print("The equation is solved!")
else:
    print("The equation is not solved.")

# If f(x) is a general algebraic solution, then the equation should be solved
# However, we know that there is no algebraic solution for this equation, so the assumption that f(x) is a general algebraic solution must be false
# Therefore, we have reached a contradiction, and we can conclude that the Ruffini-Abel theorem is true
